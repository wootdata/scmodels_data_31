SCUD the Disposable Asassin (HalfLife player Model) 2/5/99

I figured out how to use Valve's miniSDK, and I noticed that on
coldfusion, SCUD was the second most requested model. Ask and ye
shall receive.

This is an entirely new model with new maps, but I used Valve's biped
and anims. SCUD's maps DO NOT hue shift, but he does have chrome,
and there's two versions of him. SCUD the original comic book version,
(red chrome and yellow) and my own Evil SCUD (chrome and black).

Drop the folders "scud" and "evlscud" in your models\player directory
and have fun.

These models were really built just to figure out the SDK, so don't
critique them too harshly. Now that my buddies and I got this nailed,
you are gonna see some cool stuff:)

Distribute freely and DO NOT SELL these models. SCUD is copyrighted by
Fireman Press or something, so I do not really own the rights to these
models, and cannot grant permission to sell them.

DO NOT repackage these models without this readme.

We'll be putting up a site the weekend of 2/6/99 to distibute our models,
so check out valveworld.com, and planethalflife.com to find out where.
