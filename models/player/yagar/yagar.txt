y.a.g.a.r - yet another goddamn astolfo reskin made by ryor

today came up with a super original and cool idea: is to make an astolfo player model reskin. that's right, yet another anime player model reskin, out of 982174892174 existing ones! this is much better than coming up with a good idea and porting or making something new! because this is so damn original, i bet no one thought about that earlier! i am such a genius to come up with ideas like these!
whats new:
the skin color is now green
"under where" is now white (although you wont notice it because of no flat shade)
some parts glow in dark, some don't
half of the left leg is replaced with a shotgun
head is replaced with a watermelon (with inverted colors texture)
shoe on the right leg is now transparent
walking, jumping and swimming animations are now reversed
soviet march plays whenever you jump
the model is now 140000 polys because of a small ryors_sphere in it. oh youre saying it will lag for you? well i dont give a shit actually
also i didnt flat shade some textures because i am super stupid
